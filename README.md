Spam SMS Detector
Overview
This Python project is designed to detect spam messages in SMS data. It utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple interactive user interface for real-time predictions.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: nltk, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-sms-detector.git
Install the required Python libraries:
Copy code
pip install nltk pandas numpy scikit-learn
Download NLTK stopwords dataset:
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage
Place your SMS dataset in CSV format as sms_spam.csv in the project directory.

Run the main Python script:

Copy code
python spam_sms_detector.py
Follow the prompts to interact with the detector. Enter an SMS message, and the program will predict whether it's spam or not.
Project Structure
spam_sms_detector.py: The main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and user interaction.
sms_spam.csv: Example dataset for training and testing the spam detector.
Customization
Adding New Data: To use your own dataset, replace sms_spam.csv with your data, ensuring it has two columns: 'text' (for SMS messages) and 'label' (for classification labels).

Customizing Model: If you wish to experiment with different machine learning models or algorithms, you can replace the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier in the code.

Enhancements: Consider implementing more advanced techniques like TF-IDF or using different classifiers for potentially improved performance.

Acknowledgements
The project uses the NLTK library for natural language processing tasks.
The dataset used in this project is for demonstration purposes and is not representative of actual SMS data.
